Halfway around the globe, a former Knicks point guard, Stephon Marbury, is faring far better. Marbury scored 41 points in the fifth game of the Chinese Basketball Association finals Friday night to help lead the Beijing Ducks to their first league title. Marbury scored 53 points in Game 3 of the finals and 52 points in Game 2, each a victory."

Putting up the cameras was Mr. Ai's way of commenting on the fact that he has been under constant surveillance since he was released from detention. Mr. Ai is not allowed to leave Beijing, and plainclothes security officers are stationed on his street around the clock. A security camera is trained on the main entrance of his studio and home in the Caochangdi district of Beijing. On Wednesday, Mr. Ai said over Twitter that his web camera project had been operating for 46 hours before being shut down. \"Byebye to all the voyeurs,\" Mr. Ai wrote in English on Twitter four hours after the camera Web site, weiweicam.com, ended operations."
