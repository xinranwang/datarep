The sky was clear, for once. Everything shut down. There was no smog or dust or traffic jams. No tourists. No cars.'' He looked at me closely, to make sure I was the sort of American who understood that, of course, he also knew that SARS was a terrible plague that killed people. But it was important nonetheless to acknowledge the marvel of the moment when Beijing stopped. ''One day they announced SARS was over,'' he said, almost wistfully. ''And it was as if nothing had ever happened.'' Serendipity took me to the city twice this year, once last spring when SARS was just emerging in public and then again this fall. Most people described its impact in the same terms Jeremy did -- as a surreal interlude. The authorities responded in the traditional way of Beijing: They built a wall. First to conceal the virus, then to stamp it out. All of Beijing became a forbidden city closed to travelers. People withdrew behind masks and the walls of houses and apartments. After the early days of panic, however, something unexpected happened: Behind their walls the healthy began to cultivate various internal gardens. ''I read books,'' one said with wonder. ''I listened to music.'' It was a parenthesis in time, strange and unlikely because building walls is no longer the business of Beijing. Tearing them down is."

It was a warm day, like every day in Haikou. Outside the gym, walkers and cyclists in straw hats weaved sluggishly among the palm trees. Inside, the future of Chinese basketball couldn't stop himself from yawning. Chen Jianghua had just turned 14. At 6-foot-1 and 165 pounds, with a vertical shock of black hair and a face full of fine, sharp angles, he resembled an underfed cockatiel. Stripped to his waist, Chen was so skinny that his ribs stuck out as he rose for his jump shots. He skimmed along on what an insider called ''Ray Allen legs,'' after the elegant N.B.A. sharpshooter: pipe stems through the ankle, with a pomegranate of fast-twitch muscle high in the calf. They were legs that portended explosion."
