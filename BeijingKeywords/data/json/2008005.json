The rings stand for the five continents (North and South America share a ring, and Antarctica lacks eligible bipeds). But how tempting those adaptable rings are when it comes to protest, particularly against China, host of the 2008 Games. Creative alterations of the rings have highlighted grievances as the Olympic torch has made its way from city to city in the last couple of weeks. Many of the doctored-logo signs call for a free Tibet. Some call for an end to the Chinese role as an enabler to Sudan in the genocide in Darfur, and at least one calls for the independence of the Uighurs, a Muslim minority in western China."
