It is abysmal. As a matter of principle, China's human rights abuses and suppression of dissent should disqualify it from holding the Olympics. But with the United States remaining neutral on China's bid, and the rest of the world unwilling to make human rights a decisive issue, the I.O.C. seems likely to approve the Chinese application. Having turned down China once before, in 1993 when it applied to be host to the 2000 Games, which were awarded to Sydney instead, many I.O.C. members are reluctant to disappoint the Chinese again. Since the modern Olympic movement began in 1896, China has never played host to the event."
