His wife, Liu Xia, is under house arrest in Beijing. The Nobel winners said in a statement on Thursday, ''The international community seems to have forgotten that, a year after the award ceremony, Liu Xiaobo remains in prison in China and in harsh conditions.'' The five Nobel winners calling for Mr. Liu's release are Archbishop Desmond Tutu, Shirin Ebadi, Jody Williams, Mairead Maguire and Betty Williams."
