The crowd heard Chuck D, the Public Enemy frontman, deliver a politically charged rap, saying: ''The people have a voice, the people want choice''; ''We got freedom of speech''; ''Break the power''; and ''Fight the powers that be.'' An army of security guards looked on as the crowd jumped up and down and chanted with him. The trend toward allowing controversial material was attributed to China's pledge of greater openness in advance of the Olympics in Beijing next year."
