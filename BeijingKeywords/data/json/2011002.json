But if their interests run to the Cultural Revolution that tore the country apart from 1966 to 1976 and resulted in millions of deaths, they will have to search a back corner of the two-million-square-foot museum, which will complete its opening this month, for a single photograph and three lines of text that are the only reference to that era."

Nevertheless, Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi's message is not without controversy. It comes just weeks before the European Union will revisit its hotly debated sanctions policy, and a few disquieted Western policymakers, corporate executives and think tanks are advocating for economic engagement with the reclusive generals and their cronies. Sanctions policy is not only antiquated, ineffective, and hurtful to the Burmese people, they argue, it also gives the upper hand to China, which is sending companies to Burma with abandon, especially for big-ticket energy projects tapping natural gas reserves."

        "lead_paragraph": "In the far west of Beijing, in a neighborhood called Apple Orchard, there is a small concrete bunker with a green sign at its mouth that says, ''Air-Defense Basement.'' Down three flights of stairs into a tunnel lighted only by the occasional fluorescent bulb, the air gets cold and musty, and as you walk through here, it's impossible not to think that hideous things could happen without anyone ever knowing. Eventually you come upon a doorway with a white air-lock portal, which opens onto another corridor that splits off in two directions. At the end of one branch, there is a metal door framed by red paper banners, one of which reads, ''May good things you want to happen come to pass.'' This is where Wang Xiuli lives with her husband and 16-year-old son, in two rooms that together add up to about 215 square feet, one of the largest apartments available in this warren of tunnels. Thick pipes protrude from the ceiling, and a window in the front room opens onto nowhere, just another gray tunnel wall beyond it. A blue plastic table and bright pink, orange and green chairs, meant as a play set for children, serve as the family's dining table. There is no heating, and the day I visited, Wang's husband, who works as a deliveryman for a hip clothing company called Vancl, lay sick in bed. The ruddy-cheeked Wang herself stood bundled in a red down jacket, stuffing plastic bottles into a clear trash bag. A full bag, sold to a recycler, could fetch about 40 cents. Her son stood by watching."

The church, Shouwang, an evangelical Protestant congregation that was evicted from its rented quarters this month, has been at loggerheads with the government since announcing plans to gather outdoors rather than disband or return to worshiping in private homes. The authorities have repeatedly stymied Shouwang's efforts to lease or buy space for its 1,000-member congregation, one of the largest and most prominent so-called house churches in the capital."
