Last year, China displaced France as the art world's third-biggest auction market, after the United States and Britain. The red-hot center of Chinese art is the Dashanzi arts district, situated in and around the former Factory 798 in northeast Beijing, just off the Airport Expressway. That two-million-square-foot complex of galleries, studios, museums, boutiques and cafes is becoming one of the city's most unusual tourist attractions. It's SoHo and Greenwich Village with Chinese characteristics."
