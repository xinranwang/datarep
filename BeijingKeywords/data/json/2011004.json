It was a rare instance in which officials had mentioned compensation in relation to the killings. However, the group said in a letter circulated on the Internet that the police officials did not talk about revealing the truth of the killings, legal redress or the possibility of addressing each case. Instead, ''they simply raised the issue of how much money should be given and stressed that this is for individuals, not the group as a whole,'' said the letter, which had 127 signatures. The group said: ''The bottom line is this: the souls of those killed during June 4 shall not be defiled; their families shall not be dishonored.''"

Just as June 4 in Beijing ended many illusions about the nature of the Communist Party of China, so events of the past year have stripped away many illusions about the country's ''peaceful rise.'' No longer does the region assume that peace is a given and Chinese economic growth will not create other problems. Instead, the focus is on managing conflicts and attempting to allay mutual suspicions through dialogue."

The new line, once set to run at up to 236 miles per hour, will instead run trains at 186 and 155 miles per hour, the ministry announced."

Now, while Mr. Ai remains under detention in China, without formal charges, the Asia Society is preparing to open an exhibition of 227 of his New York photographs. They show not only important East Village events like Wigstock and local characters like Allen Ginsberg, but also humble gatherings in Mr. Ai's Third Street apartment featuring people like the artist Xu Bing, the filmmaker Chen Kaige and the composer Tan Dun, all now major Chinese cultural figures who were then toiling in immigrant obscurity."

The Chinese government has criticized NATO's air campaign in Libya as excessive and called for a cease-fire, although China abstained instead of exercising its veto when the United Nations Security Council voted in March to authorize the NATO action."
