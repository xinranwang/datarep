Where is the ideal synthesis between knowing next to nothing in advance about a work of art, and hence appreciating it fresh, ''on its own terms,'' and so overpreparing that all kinds of inappropriate criteria distort one's perceptions? Such thoughts came to mind after the New York debut of the Beijing Modern Dance Company at the Joyce Theater earlier this month. About the excellence of the dancers, there could be no question. But it was less certain how an audience member should have best prepared for encountering ''Rear Light,'' the sole work on the program."

We came to Beijing in the winter because it's good to go on the Great Wall during the cold weather instead of going in the summer, when you'll be sweating all the time. At the Forbidden City, the wind was blowing quite hard and we were shaking. These guys were picking up all the snow and then they just tried to hit me. They said: ''This is the right time to throw snow at the pastor. You'll never have another chance to throw snow at the pastor.'' As told to Seth Kugel"
