But while those trials have ended, almost nothing is known about the hundreds of others who are in prison for taking part in the Tiananmen democracy movement. The Chinese have never given an accounting of those arrested in the crackdown beginning in June 1989, but most estimates are that more than 1,000 people are still in prison, detention centers or re-education camps for their involvement in the Tiananmen Square protests."

When the heat of Beijing became unbearable, all the more stifling for the layers of silk royalty wore, the imperial court would sometimes travel about seven miles northwest of the city to a tranquil lakeside enclave called the Garden of Peace and Harmony. Usually referred to as the Summer Palace, it is a sprawling, mazelike collection of halls and rooms with names like Chamber of Enjoying Prosperity and Abode in Clouds and Pines. When the weather heats up, the place fills with local Chinese, but if you go on a weekday, you can stroll in peace on the covered path beside the lake. Under the long walkway's slightly arched rooftop are more than 1,000 delicate paintings of other cool places in China."

After months of preparations, the Chinese leadership formally announced its bid today to become the host of the 27th Olympiad. Prime Minister Li Peng said in a letter sent today to the International Olympic Committee that China would try \"to make the 2000 Olympic Games a grand celebration in sports marking the advent of a new millennium with a better prospect of peace and friendship.\""
