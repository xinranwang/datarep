''My proposal is that the June 4 student movement of 1989 should be reappraised as a patriotic movement,'' Dr. Jiang Yanyong wrote in a letter dated Feb. 24. He later added: ''Errors committed by our party should be resolved by the party. The sooner this is done, the better.''"

Even though police officers now watch his home, Mr. Dong said by telephone last week, he is still trying to return to Beijing."

But as the 15th anniversary approaches, it is clear that neither time nor official propaganda has erased the events from China's political consciousness.
