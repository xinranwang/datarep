Wan Li ascended the Dragon Throne when he was only 9, but was diligently tutored in history, ritual and statecraft by a minister named Zhang Juzheng. Ensconced in the Forbidden City, he lived a coddled life, doted on by his mother, waited upon by legions of eunuchs and served by multitudes of women, among them his empress (whom he married at 14), a principal consort, associate consorts and hosts of ordinary concubines. But despite all this -- or perhaps because of it -- Wan Li was not a happy monarch."
