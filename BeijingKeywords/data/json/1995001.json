        "lead_paragraph": "Hillary Rodham Clinton will spend two days at a United Nations-sponsored conference on women in Beijing early next month, the White House announced today, only 24 hours after China expelled a Chinese-born American who had been convicted on spying charges. In a statement released in Wyoming, where President Clinton and his family are vacationing, the White House said \"the conference presents a significant chance to chart further gains in the status of women.\" Mrs. Clinton, the honorary chairwoman of the American delegation, will speak to the conference and talk with members of advocacy groups meeting separately in Huairou, near the Chinese capital."

The statement by Joaquin Navarro-Valls, the spokesman for Pope John Paul II, came as the Vatican announced that its 22-member delegation will include 14 women and will be headed by Mary Ann Glendon, an American legal scholar whose appointment had been quietly urged by the Clinton Administration."
