The killing of the journalist, Lan Chengzhang, a reporter for the newspaper China Trade News, drew widespread protests from reporters in China and media advocacy groups abroad. Mr. Lan was attacked on Jan. 10, along with a colleague, when they went to interview the owner of the mine, near the northern city of Datong, in Shanxi Province. Seven people have been detained so far in the incident, and three others are still being sought, according to published reports."

Pretty much like their road show business in this country. Beijing Oriental Broadway International Theater Management Company, a joint venture between the Nederlanders and a Chinese company, will manage tours of Broadway musicals, some of which will be performed in Chinese. The company will also work with theater managers on marketing and customer service and help establish a network of theaters. The first show, a touring production of ''42nd Street,'' in English, that kicks off in September, is planned for five cities. ''It's going to grow substantially from there,'' Robert Nederlander Jr., president of Nederlander Worldwide, said. CAMPBELL ROBERTSON"
