There were rows of vintage Mao wristwatches, red and black feng-shui meters, brightly embroidered Tibetan booties and slim, early-Communist-era cigarette cases. We could buy tea-stained calligraphy scrolls and vintage Cultural Revolution posters. We could bargain over the earliest Chinese radios and glass mirrors with etchings of the Imperial family. We could bargain over just about anything. Because Tony and I and our two boys had recently made it through the circus that was my cancer treatment, it somehow seemed natural to be in this crazy place with Beijing's castoffs. We were in need of some help -- a statue of an animal god or a torn Tibetan prayer flag to take back to our apartment and help keep watch. That's what we were doing every day without having to say it: keeping watch, knocking on wood. And that's why I motioned impulsively to a man in a black polyester sport coat who looked as if he might own the giant Buddha head in Aisle 5. The guy in the sport coat said in English that this Buddha was old. Very old. Four thousand Chinese yuan old, to be exact."

He often races to the scene of natural disasters to comfort survivors. On state-run television, he can be seen eating with the poor in rural villages. Though often stage-managed by Chinese news media, his common touch has earned him the nickname ''Grandpa Wen.'' But this week, the 68-year-old prime minister made what many analysts consider a bolder statement: he appeared at the nation's top petition bureau in Beijing, where people go to file grievances, and encouraged citizens to criticize the government and press their cases for justice."

On Tuesday, a Foreign Ministry spokeswoman defended the new restrictions and the behavior of the police, suggesting that the authorities were simply trying to maintain order. ''The police provided reasonable guidance, and the journalists should understand and cooperate,'' the spokeswoman, Jiang Yu, said at a regular news conference. ''If both sides take this attitude, we can minimize the occurrence of such incidents.''"
