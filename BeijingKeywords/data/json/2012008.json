Mr. Ai said he did not owe that amount and has argued that his wife, Lu Qing, is formally in charge of the company. Mr. Ai was detained for 81 days last year and has continued to mock the Chinese government and the Communist Party since his release."

But the apparatchik and the dissident, the insider and the outsider, were of similar mind on one count. When each man fell into danger, he rushed to the sovereign diplomatic territory of the United States."

Researchers examined 125 healthy young doctors, average age 24, before, during and after the Games, measuring their heart rates and blood pressure and testing their blood for various biomarkers associated with cardiovascular disease and death. The scientists found that blood levels of P-selectin, CD40 ligand and von Willebrand factor, all markers of inflammation, significantly declined during the Olympics, when the air was cleaner."
