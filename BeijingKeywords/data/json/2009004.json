He's on his knees as a supplicant, confessing; his body language and facial expression indicate deep remorse. What's more, the head of this life-size bronze statue, titled ''Mao's Guilt'' and created by the artist brothers Gao Zhen and Gao Qiang, separates from the body -- by design. Exhibitions by the Gao brothers, whose work the authorities find politically challenging, have been shut down in the past, and their studio has been raided. So they keep the head of Mao hidden in a separate location -- reuniting it with its body only on special occasions to show friends and colleagues. Normally, the body of the statue remains headless, unidentifiable and nonthreatening."

Visually, this is some of the sheerest and least emphatic art ever made: ink, water, maybe a little color; a scribble, a splash. By comparison, Corot and Watteau are meat-and-potatoes fare. Especially elusive is the work of the scholar-artists who distanced themselves from the imperial court, with its demands for luxe and finesse. Their paintings are often tabletop small and as private as diaries, records of a world in which the single certainty is constant change."

Still, if it's the latter you're looking for, you won't have to go far. The hotel comes from Cho, as he's known, a Beijing night-life whiz whose popular Bed Bar is just a few doors down; his Café Sambal and Paper restaurants are also nearby."

Starting in 1989, the 52-year-old Australian has opened a pair of Continental restaurants that thrive in Hong Kong's Central district and on Shanghai's riverfront. But just as Ms. Garnaut was launching her latest venture, Capital M, in Beijing, the Chinese Communist government had plans of its own: celebrating the 60th anniversary of the People's Republic of China with an enormous military-style parade off Tiananmen Square -- right in front of the restaurant."
