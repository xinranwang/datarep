The small apartment was the equivalent of a safe house: Ms. Wu, head of a local animal rescue association, had stashed about 10 strays and handicapped mutts. She said the dogs, one paralyzed, another recovering from a broken spine, should be exempt from a new ''strike hard'' campaign against dogs in Beijing. But she was not certain."

On a rare pristine day, when the wind has swept Beijing, he can see the Fragrant Mountain rising to the northwest. On a ''good'' pollution day, he can see the China World building four blocks away. On a bad day, he can't see the building next door. Shortly before I arrived in Beijing, China had been host of a summit meeting of 42 African leaders. Time magazine reported that Beijing officials had ''ordered half a million official cars off the roads and said 400,000 more drivers had 'volunteered' to refrain from using their vehicles'' in order to clean up the air for their African guests. No sooner were they gone, however, than all the cars returned and Beijing's air went back to ''unhealthy.'' China's Environmental Protection Administration, Time noted, recently estimated the annual number of premature deaths in China caused by air pollution at 358,000."
