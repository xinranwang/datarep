Our country is a founding member of the United Nations and is a permanent, veto-bearing member of the Security Council. Thus it should conscientiously implement this resolution, so that this spirit of tolerance, a spirit with which our country is relatively unfamiliar, may take root and flourish in areas like our country's politics, thought, religion, culture and education."
