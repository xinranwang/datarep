Nearly 90 years later another mountaineer and photographer, David Breashears, traveled to the same remote Himalayan landscape and found something that might have made Mallory think again: more than 330 vertical feet of the Rongbuk Glacier had melted in the intervening decades, leaving stubs of ice where grand pinnacles had once been. The photographs that Mr. Breashears brought back as evidence of climate change are at the heart of a multimedia exhibition that opened here last weekend at a prestigious photography gallery in China, Three Shadows."

It is also the first attempt by the International Cycling Union to act as a race organizer as well as the sport's governing body. That dual role almost crippled the race before it started and made it the most contentious event on this year's calendar."

One day a real dragon came down to check things out, pressing its nose up against Lord Ye's window while its tail swished about outside. Lord Ye, scared out of his wits, turned around and fled. I am reminded of the story as I observe the centennial of China's 1911 revolution, the series of uprisings that brought down the Qing dynasty and established a democratic republic. The government loves the hoopla, which culminates Monday, as long as it can invent it and control it. But when the real thing shows any sign of approaching, it panics."

But that world premiere occurred by default. The opera, which was written to commemorate the centennial of the 1911 revolution that ended the Qing dynasty, was to have been performed in Beijing on Sept. 30 at the National Center for the Performing Arts, known as the Egg, where it was expected to add luster to the center's fast-growing offerings of opera."
