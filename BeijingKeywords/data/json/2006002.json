But the government-controlled All-China Federation of Trade Unions has campaigned to set up branches in China, where Wal-Mart employs 30,000 people at 60 outlets."

In my case, the ticket clerk meant it literally: Tickets for tomorrows T70 train to Beijing from Urumqi, the capital of Chinas far western Xinjiang province, were sold out. No seats, no sleepers nothing was available for four days. My only option for tomorrow, she explained (with the help of my taxi driver, whose elementary English complemented my elementary Chinese), was to buy a hard seat on the 52-hour ride ... to Shanghai."

        "lead_paragraph": "MAXJET EXPANDS AGAIN -- MaxJet, one of two start-up airlines operating low-fare trans-Atlantic all-business-class flights, is expected to announce today that it is adding a third route -- between Las Vegas and Stansted Airport in London. The nonstop flights, with round-trip fares at $1,999, will operate twice weekly. Tickets go on sale Friday. MaxJet flies Boeing 767 aircraft configured with 102 seats. Late last year, it began service between Kennedy International Airport in New York and London, and then began a second route between Washington-Dulles and London. Also late last year, another low-fare start-up, Eos Airlines, began flying all-business-class service between Kennedy and Stansted using Boeing 757's equipped with 48 fully reclining seats. A third start-up, called Silverjet, plans to begin similar service between Newark Liberty International Airport and Luton Airport, serving London, next year. WHITHER MILEAGE PROGRAMS? -- Twenty-five years after airlines introduced frequent-flier mileage award programs, many travelers say benefits and rewards have decreased, as award tickets became harder to claim, especially at the lowest levels. More than three-quarters of the approximately 1,750 people questioned said the only travelers who benefited significantly from frequent-flier programs now are business travelers, who are able to accumulate large numbers of miles and use them for upgrades and other elite-status benefits. A fifth of those questioned said they had redeemed miles for trips within the last year. The research was commissioned by Etihad Airways, based in the United Arab Emirates, which plans to start a loyalty program on Wednesday and focus on providing a wider range of choices for customers, like preferred seat selections for lower-tier members. LABOR DAY TRAVEL -- About 35.2 million Americans will take a trip of more than 50 miles this Labor Day weekend, a 1.2 percent increase over last year despite higher gasoline prices, according to AAA. About 84 percent will travel by car, also slightly more than last year. And about 11 percent will fly, down slightly, the automobile club said. Other costs are also up this Labor Day weekend compared with 2005, AAA said. Rooms at midprice hotels are up 5 percent, and car rental rates have shot up more than 14 percent. ADVICE FROM NORTHWEST -- Though a planned work disruption by flight attendants was postponed last week, many Northwest Airlines employees are angry about a tip sheet listing 101 ways to save money that the airline has handed out to employees being laid off. The list, as reported last week by National Public Radio and archived on its Web site NPR.org, includes the following tips: ''Rent out a room or garage.'' ''Shop in thrift stores'' ''Bicycle to work'' and ''Don't be shy about pulling something you like out of the trash.'' ET CETERA -- Hampton Hotels, the first hotel brand to guarantee free high-speed Internet service, in 2004, is providing new location-specific default home pages for guests logging online at its 1,350 properties. The sites provide news, local weather, local maps and information on things like restaurants. Hampton is a midprice brand owned by the Hilton Hotels Corporation Omni Hotels ranked highest among 13 national upscale hotel chains, according to the J. D. Power & Associates 2006 guest satisfaction study China Southern Airlines, China's biggest carrier, has started its first service between Shanghai and Beijing. JOE SHARKEY"

Here, within a four-story mall of nearly identical small shops in downtown Beijing, you can have prescription lenses tested and fitted in 45 minutes. The selection of glasses is so varied and so cheap -- seven pairs for, say, $100 -- you can adopt several different personas. Some shops even offer buggy ''swimming glasses.'' Contact lenses are on the fourth floor."
