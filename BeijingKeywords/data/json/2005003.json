Mr. Han's near-photographic ''Break Time at the Ironworks'' shows muscular men dripping with sweat and drinking water from tin cups at a sweltering foundry. Mr. Son's ''Peak Chonnyo of Mount Kumgang'' is a classical Korean landscape of towering cliffs shrouded by mists. Together they essentially represent the two creative outlets for artists in North Korea today: Soviet-influenced socialist realist depictions of industrial workers, and traditional studies of nature. In neighboring China, where many young artists have gravitated toward more globalized, contemporary styles, those genres have largely gone the way of socialism. But in North Korea, one of the world's most isolated countries, it seems that they are still rigorously maintained."

        "lead_paragraph": "DEPRESSED DOMESTIC FARES -- Despite small, incremental fare increases imposed half a dozen times so far this year by major domestic carriers, the average domestic one-way air fare paid during the first quarter of 2005 was $202, which is 13 percent lower than the $234 average in the period last year, according to the American Express Business Travel Monitor. The survey, which reflects fares paid by clients of American Express Business Travel, a corporate travel management company, encompasses first-class, unrestricted coach and discount coach tickets. American Express said that fares were depressed because of continuing competitive rate cuts on many routes, as well as aggressive corporate negotiating on fares. The recent rounds of fare increases appear to be having an effect, though. In April, the average domestic one-way fare was $210, up $8 from the first-quarter average, American Express said. By comparison, for all of 2000, the average domestic one-way fare was $259. International fares are going up, meanwhile. On 160 monitored routes, the average fare rose 4 percent in the first quarter of 2005, largely reflecting strong demand for business-class and first-class travel. WANTED: HIGH-SPEED INTERNET -- Hotel managers say that business travelers overwhelmingly want high-speed Internet access -- and do not want to be charged extra for it. That's according to the annual Hotel Pulse survey in Business Travel Executive, a magazine for corporate travel managers. More than three-quarters of hotel managers surveyed said that high-speed Internet access was ''the most frequently requested value-added amenity'' to be included in room rates. The high-speed Internet appears to be edging out fitness clubs in the opinion of business travelers, with 18 percent of hotel managers citing clubs as the most requested amenity, compared with 53 percent last year. ROOMIER REGIONAL JETS -- Responding to customer dissatisfaction with cramped, one-class regional jets, United Airlines introduced the new 70-seat Bombardier CRJ-700 and Embraer -170 regional jets, which offer United First and Economy Plus seating, to six markets flown by its United Express subsidiary. The new planes replace 50-seat regional jets. They are being flown on six United Express markets with flights into United hub airports at Chicago O'Hare International Airport and Washington Dulles International Airport. ''Customer feedback on this aircraft has been very positive, and our passengers appreciate the additional seat comfort and space,'' Sean Donohue, United's vice president for United Express and Ted, the company's low-cost airline, said in a statement. Regional jets now account for one out of every four flights in the United States. FLIGHTS TO CHINA INCREASE -- Singapore Airlines has added a third daily flight between Singapore and Beijing as regional business travel demand for service to China grows in Asia Continental Airlines said last week that it became the first domestic commercial airline to start service to mainland China in 20 years when it began daily nonstop flights between Newark and Beijing British Airways began five-day-a-week service between London and Shanghai. ''I've been a regular visitor to Shanghai during the last decade and know just how the economy is booming. We want to be part of its growth,'' said Martin Broughton, chairman of the airline. The Shanghai service is British Airways' first new long-haul route since late 2002 Boeing says the Asia-Pacific region, dominated by China, will account for 36 percent of the 25,700 new aircraft, worth $2.1 trillion, that it projects will be ordered in the next 20 years. ON-DEMAND IN-FLIGHT ENTERTAINMENT -- Air Canada said it was installing new Thales in-flight entertainment systems offering on-demand video and audio on its entire fleet of 241 planes, including new CRJ-705 and Embraer 175 and 190 jets. That will be the first time an all-digital on-demand in-flight entertainment system will be available on the new jets from Bombardier and Embraer, which are regarded as more comfortable successors to regional jets.

It is a task that would overwhelm most cities, but Beijing is so efficient at pouring concrete that the International Olympic Committee has asked it to slow down rather than finish construction too soon. Far more difficult will be fulfilling Beijing's promise of playing host to a ''green'' Olympics as well as meeting a new goal in the city's revised master plan -- to become ''a city suitable for living.''"
