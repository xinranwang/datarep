Built during the capital's rush toward last year's Olympics, this 99-room boutique property is the first from Swire Hotels, a new Hong Kong-based group with international ambitions. And at a boxy six stories, clad in screen-printed glass in pixilated shades of green, it's a Kengo Kuma-designed stunner that has the city's chattering classes exclaiming over its generous rooms and dramatic, moodily lit atrium -- all offering an aura of quiet and intimacy.

The second is that after the summer of 1989 the incident vanished from the Chinese news media. As a result, few young Chinese know anything about it."

It was our 14-year-old daughter, Olivia, on a language study trip in Beijing. She is usually calm and upbeat. Now she was frantic and crying: ''Mommy, I have a temperature and I'm coughing, and they're taking me to the hospital. I want to come home.''"
