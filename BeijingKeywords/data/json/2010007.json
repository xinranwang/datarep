The alleys, called hutongs, are among the few historic residential areas that have not been demolished in the city's rush to accommodate a fast-growing population and capitalize on ballooning land prices. The redevelopment plan called for the hutongs and the old Drum Tower, a Beijing landmark, to accommodate a new museum of timekeeping, a high-end underground shopping center and parking. Most residents had been awaiting an order to move out. The newspaper quoted an unidentified city official as saying the so-called Time Cultural City is ''a thing of the past,'' but said the neighborhood's future remained unclear."

Kissinger, a former secretary of state and national security adviser, warned at a conference here of the risk of a confrontation between the world's two biggest economies unless they create ''a pattern of continuous cooperation.''"

It was the Confucian exam season, when candidates from around China flocked to the capital to be tested, and Ricci had been besieged by visitors -- sometimes 100 a day. The men who knocked unbidden were drawn by his knowledge of astronomy, mathematics, mechanics, philosophy, literature and rhetoric; the widely popular books he had written -- in Chinese -- including ''On Friendship'' and ''Ten Discourses of a Strange Man''; his Chinese translation of Euclid's ''Geometry''; annotated maps of the world; deep knowledge of the Confucian classics; phenomenally trained memory -- he could scan a list of 500 Chinese characters once and then recite it from memory -- backwards -- and, no doubt, his reputation for sincerity and modesty."
