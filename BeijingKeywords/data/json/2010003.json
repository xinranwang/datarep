Brokers Brothers Herald, Mr. Dylan's Taiwan-based promoter, said the Chinese culture ministry gave Mr. Dylan ''no alternative'' but to cancel subsequent shows in Hong Kong and Taiwan. ''The chance to play in China was the main attraction for him,'' Jeffrey Wu, Brokers' chief of operations, told The South China Morning Post of Hong Kong. ''When that fell through, everything else was called off.'' The ministry did not respond to telephone calls from Agence France-Presse on Sunday, but Mr. Wu said that the Chinese government had become more selective about performances by foreigners after Bjork's 2008 concert in Shanghai, where she shouted ''Tibet, Tibet!'' while performing her song ''Declare Independence.'' Later that year China imposed rules on such concerts, including one that said, ''Those who used to take part in activities that harm our nation's sovereignty are firmly not allowed to perform in China.''"

China so far has only agreed to negotiations about sanctions -- even as President Hu Jintao has said he would come to Washington, and the Obama administration seems ready to postpone formally naming China a currency manipulator -- but that alone is being seen as a favorable sign, amid a general improvement in the bilateral mood."

Mr. Su, author of ''Wives and Concubines'' (made into the film ''Raise the Red Lantern''), ''My Life as Emperor'' and, most recently, the Man Asian Literary Prize-winning ''The Boat to Redemption,'' wondered, to general amusement, why Chinese writers seem to run out of steam at a much younger age than Western writers."

        "lead_paragraph": "DALIN, TAIWAN -- When a Taiwan music ensemble performed its reconstruction of Chinese imperial court music last year in Beijing, it marked not just a cultural milestone, but a political one. The concert provided a rare opportunity to hear ancient sounds salvaged from a nearly vanished musical tradition. The 3,000-year-old genre known as yayue, or ''elegant music,'' faded with the collapse of dynastic rule in 1911, and nearly succumbed to the later Maoist assault on ''feudalistic'' elements of China's past."

The training creates potential Chinese allies for G.E. to help ensure its continued expansion in the world's fastest-growing major economy, company officials say. It is part of an emphasis on government relations that has paid off with contracts to supply jet engines and build wind turbines."
