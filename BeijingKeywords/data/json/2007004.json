First, Mattel recalled millions of tainted, Chinese-made toys this week -- just the latest scare over Chinese goods that is raising doubts worldwide about doing business with China.

So far, there are no signs that this virus is a threat to humans, although no one can be sure. What Beijing should have learned in 2003 -- and what it urgently needs to grasp now -- is that when it comes to public safety, secrecy is never the right policy, and there is no benefit at all in trying to go it alone."

Samuel Keller, the director of Art Basel Miami Beach, had just jetted in from Switzerland. The local hotshot painters Liu Ding and Liu Wei were huddled with the Svengali-esque curator Pi Li, and in one corner would-be collectors were chatting with one of China's most renowned contemporary artists, Ai Weiwei. Insiders could be forgiven for mistaking this as yet another gallery opening in art-crazed Beijing, with free-flowing Yen Jing beers, an international crowd and a minimalist interior of stark white walls and bare concrete floors. But then the kitchen doors swung open, and a banquet of Zhejiang province dishes like steam-dried yellow croaker and a wild-mushroom casserole in a fragrant broth poured forth."

The most important task is securing tickets, which can be difficult. Only a certain number of tickets are allocated to each country, and direct ticket-buying in each is only available to local residents. Unfortunately, the cutoff date for entering the lottery to reserve the exact tickets you want was June 30. But, though there are few guarantees of actually scoring a seat, there are other options if you're willing to compromise on price or on which events you attend."

Designed by Rem Koolhaas and Ole Scheeren of the radical Dutch firm OMA, it will be a gravity-defying, 755-foot-tall monument to architectural derring-do -- an audacious beacon and backdrop from which the images of a newly ascendant China will be beamed across the globe, one year from now, during the 2008 Summer Olympics. But when Beijing finally gets its Olympic moment in the sun, some of the thrills will simply require a room key. Rising next to the CCTV building, and also designed by OMA, the dazzling Television Cultural Center, or TVCC, peaks and plummets like a mountain cloaked in corrugated zinc. And when its ribbon is cut next year, it will be home to one of the most spectacular hotels around: a 241-room Mandarin Oriental that looks like no other. With restaurants and a bar suspended above, its modular curtain of randomly staggered rooms will hypnotically shift in and out of a head-spinning, 21-story atrium, while a circular ballroom, ringed by water, will glimmer down below."

The base is often supported by six other teammates suspended underwater, whipping their legs like egg-beaters and holding their breath, sometimes in the final seconds of an exhausting four-minute routine. ''But if someone gets kicked or loses her grip or swims the wrong way, the base can't get rattled,'' said Tammy McGregor, coach of the United States synchronized swimming team. ''She has to make split-second decisions to make it happen. She's the one person you can't do the lift without.''"
