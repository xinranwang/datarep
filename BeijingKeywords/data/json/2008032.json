But he had one more person he needed to consult: Michael Phelps. ''Michael was the first outsider I talked to about it,'' Mr. Ebersol said in an interview from Beijing, where he wrapped up NBC's coverage of the Games Sunday. He said he wanted to make sure that competing in the morning would not harm the performance of the likely American star of the Games."

The video, meant to showcase London arts and culture, included Marcus Harvey's painting of Myra Hindley, who with her lover was convicted of the so-called moors murders in the 1960s. The video was produced by Visit London, a tourism organization not affiliated with the organizers of London 2012, which is promoting the next Summer Games. It was screened at a Beijing party where the guests included Prime Minister Gordon Brown and the mayor of London, Boris Johnson. A spokesman for Mr. Johnson said he was ''deeply disturbed'' that the painting had been shown. A Downing Street spokesman said, ''The use of this image is in extremely poor taste and it should not have been used to promote London.''"
