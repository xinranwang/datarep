But the investigation's scope and its ultimate goals are wider, as the party's two most powerful officials aim to shake up the leadership and wipe out resistance to their policy agenda, party officials and analysts say. The investigation, the largest of its kind since China first pursued market-style changes to its economy more than a quarter-century ago, was planned and supervised by Zeng Qinghong, China's vice president and the day-to-day manager of Communist Party affairs, people informed about the operation said."

Hong Kong's average air pollution levels can be so high -- double or even triple the World Health Organization limit -- that some analysts estimate the air contributes to an extra 2,000 deaths a year.

During the Cuban missile crisis, the New York City Ballet was sent to perform in Moscow, where it was received enthusiastically. And during these troubled times? America's newest good-will ambassador is Michelle Kwan, the figure skater, who, in the words of her new boss, Karen P. Hughes, the under secretary of state for public diplomacy, ''combines the power of sports diplomacy with the personal appeal of a unique American story.''"
