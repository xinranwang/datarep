Since most people will be flying into Beijing, Hong Kong or Shanghai, we suggest basing yourself in one of these three cities, each in its own state of frenzied transformation. As two Times correspondents, David Barboza in Shanghai and Keith Bradsher in Hong Kong, and Dan Levin, a regular contributor from Beijing point out, each city is a study in contrasts. Dazzling, ultramodern skylines conceal hidden corners of traditional China: historic neighborhoods crisscrossed by alleyways in Beijing; teahouses in Shanghai; and centuries-old temples in Hong Kong. Which isn't to say that these metropolises, with their up-to-the-minute shops, galleries, restaurants and bars don't possess their own magic. They do. Below, essential tips on what to see and do for a week in China's gateway cities. BEIJING"
