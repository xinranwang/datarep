Suddenly, he said, among the white-uniformed soldiers holding bouquets of red flowers and the rows of bright blue military tanks, ''everywhere I looked, I saw either a volunteer guard with a red armband or a policeman or a soldier.'' Feeling conflicted about what he considered to be an overzealous display of control by the Chinese authorities, Mr. Ji, 46, said he rode home to place an online order for ''The 120 Days of Sodom,'' the scandalous 18th-century French novel by the Marquis de Sade. ''For some reason,'' explained Mr. Ji, who was born in Beijing but is now an American citizen, ''whenever I go to China, I feel the need to transgress.''"
