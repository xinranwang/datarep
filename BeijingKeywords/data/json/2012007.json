Indeed, the museum -- which offers more than 80 exhibitions a year -- set aside three full months for ''Deng Tuo Donated Treasures of Ancient Chinese Paintings,'' making it one of the longest shows in its history. Even so, the response was so overwhelming, with thousands of visitors per day, that the museum made the unusual decision to extend the exhibition, which opened in January, in reduced form through May 15. About a third of the works are now on view in seven top-floor galleries under the amended title ''Paintings of Ming and Qing Dynasties --Selections of Chinese Ancient Paintings Donated by Deng Tuo.''"
