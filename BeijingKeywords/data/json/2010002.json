The group, from an art district known as Zheng Yang, negotiated the compensation after a single meeting with local officials, said Zhang Jun, the representative. That group, along with artists from a district called 008, protested along a wide ceremonial avenue, Chang'an Jie, that runs between Tiananmen Square and the Forbidden City in late February after about 100 men wearing white masks and armed with iron rods swarmed through the two districts and beat several artists."

So when it opened its first resort in China in 2008, it aimed high: the Qing dynasty Summer Palace on the northwest outskirts of Beijing. (The company's second Chinese property, called Amanfayun, recently opened in Hangzhou.) Arranged around elegant courtyards, ponds and arcades, the Aman at Summer Palace, as it's called, is a sprawling compound of historic and historic-looking buildings, with 18 guestrooms, 33 suites and amenities fit for an emperor. Or, in the case of its original guesthouses, the empress dowager."

''This is my last winter break before I graduate, so I came to Beijing with a few friends. I really love traveling, and always do it during my school vacations. Sometimes I skip school to do it but don't tell my parents. I've been to Qinghai, Guangxi, but never to Beijing, because I thought it was too boring, with nothing to see. I came because I recently saw a movie called 'Summer Palace,' and there was the most beautiful scene, really short, set at the lake in the Summer Palace. So I decided I really wanted to come row a boat in this lake. I didn't know it was going to be frozen over! I came with a friend, who got lazy and went to find coffee. I trudged down to the lake by myself, got mud all over my shoes, and just lay down. The ice really stabbed into my back. On the train ride back to Chengdu, I decided I don't want to be a doctor anymore. It is a very difficult profession, and I didn't think it through clearly when I decided to go to medical school. I want to work in the film industry. You get to work everywhere in the world.'' As told to Xiyun Yang"

As Beijing's levels of foreign assistance swell and its relationship deepens with countries across Africa, Asia and Latin America, a key question emerges: What impact will investments by an opaque and repressive superpower have on governance standards in the developing world?"
