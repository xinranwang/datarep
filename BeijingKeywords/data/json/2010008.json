The police patrol around the clock, and security guards stop unfamiliar faces to check identification papers. In the morning, only one gate is open, through which parents head off to work and children go to school. At night, the gate is locked, preventing street loiterers from trespassing. The area, Shoubaozhuang, is not one of the affluent, gated residential compounds springing up around Beijing, but a poor village of rural migrants toiling at low-paying jobs. It was chosen, along with 15 other areas in the Daxing district of Beijing, to be walled off to outsiders, in what officials say is an experimental effort to curb crime. The authorities say the experiment has been a success -- the Communist Party-run People's Daily said the crime rate in the walled villages in Daxing district dropped by 73 percent from April to July this year -- and the ''walled village'' concept is being quickly expanded to other districts outside Beijing's center that are populated by migrant workers."

And Songzhuang at first seems like a medium-sized town of no particular distinction, with its long, ramshackle main street lined by ordinary concrete storefronts -- little charm here. Then you notice the Land Rovers and Mercedes sedans, the art galleries and exhibition halls, and you've arrived in what has become over the past decade one of the biggest and liveliest artists' colonies in the world."

Today - Friday in Beijing - I had lunch with Angelica Cheung, the editor in chief of Vogue China, at the China Grill on the 66th floor of the Park Hyatt, and since I arrived at the restaurant a few minutes early, I took a moment to press my nose to the windows. The sprawl of new buildings - skyscrapers, hotels, apartment blocks - is almost unfathomable and seemingly endless. In front of me was the CCTV building, by Rem Koolhaas, with its twin cantilevered towers. A second building on the site caught fire during the New Year's celebration and burned, leaving a charred hulk, and the area around the complex is still under construction. Still, the dazzling architecture reminds you that you're looking at a new world. My eyes kept coming back to the Koolhaas building."
