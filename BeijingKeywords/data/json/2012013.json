There is the woman who cut out her own liver to feed her sick mother, the boy who sat awake shirtless all night to draw mosquitoes away from his slumbering parents and the man who sold himself into servitude to pay for a father's funeral. While the parables are even more familiar to most Chinese than Grimm's Fairy Tales are to Americans -- the text remains a mainstay of educational curriculum here -- they have understandably lost much of their motivational punch."
