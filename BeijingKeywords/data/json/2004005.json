The explosion occurred at 7 a.m. in the Chenjiashan Coal Mine, a state-owned mine in Shaanxi Province, said the official New China News Agency. Black smoke soon poured from the mine's ventilation pipes, said reports on the Web site of the Communist Party's official newspaper, The People's Daily, an indication that many miners could have died of gas poisoning."

Beijing's government procurement office changed its mind about buying 29.25 million yuan ($3.5 million) worth of Microsoft Windows and Office software on Nov. 27, 10 days after awarding the contract, according to a statement yesterday on its Web site. The decision underscores the challenge Microsoft, whose Windows software runs almost 95 percent of the world's personal computers, faces in building a profitable business in China. Besides competition from the local industry, which the government wants to promote, Microsoft must also cope with widespread piracy of its products. Microsoft officials in Beijing were not immediately available to comment."

Yet its Chinese proprietor, a Beijing real estate developer named Zhang Yuchen, wanted more. He added a manicured sculpture garden and two wings, copying the palace at Fontainebleau. He even dug a deep, broad moat, though uniformed guards and a spiked fence also defend the castle."
