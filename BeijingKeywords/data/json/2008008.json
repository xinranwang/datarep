In Germany, most government officials declined to talk with him at all. It was a precipitous comedown from just a few weeks ago, when Tibetans and their supporters unexpectedly upstaged Beijing's elaborate global torch relay and catapulted Tibet's cause to the forefront of the world's human rights agenda. The German and British leaders let it be known then that they would skip the opening ceremony of the Olympics."
