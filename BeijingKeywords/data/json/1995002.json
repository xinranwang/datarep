Today, Mayor Xu Kuangdi of Shanghai announced precisely that. In a series of moves aimed at speeding the advancement of East Shanghai, Mr. Xu announced that the zone was moving into the second phase of its development. Because the zone, which opened in 1990, has already established itself as an industrial base, it should now concentrate on becoming a financial center as well, Mr. Xu said."
