The signs of progress that have marred Europe and America for the past century have lately been unleashed in the world's fastest growing economy, and the eyewitnesses are lining up to testify. Not surprisingly, money is talking loud enough to drown out any dissent, as the fate of an ancient society increasingly rests in the hands of real estate developers. If ever there were an exercise in urban planning, this is it: how to modernize a civilization without obliterating its heritage; how to accommodate density without compromising quality of life; how to learn from the mistakes of the so-called developed countries, now congested and polluted, their major cities homogenized and colonized by the same handful of global brands. In ''The Last Days of Old Beijing: Life in the Vanishing Backstreets of a City Transformed'' (Walker and Company), Michael Meyer documents the city as it vanishes before his -- and our -- eyes. A former Peace Corps volunteer from Minnesota, now a writer and teacher of English, Meyer has made his home for the past two years in the hutong, the ''lanes that lattice the heart of Beijing.'' As the municipal government prepares to host the world (slogan: ''New Beijing, Great Olympics''), the hutong are being razed to make way for Range Rover showrooms, Starbucks, Pizza Hut, Hooters. The Old and Dilapidated Housing Renewal program authorized the sale of land rights for entire neighborhoods filled with one-story courtyard houses, and the preservation movement has been powerless. Meyer meets with Hua Xinmin, the daughter of a prominent local architect whose ''activism'' seems to consist of cataloging the destruction: ''As I flipped through a photo album that documented scores of courtyards pulled down over the years, Hua identified each in the voice one uses when speaking of the deceased.''"
