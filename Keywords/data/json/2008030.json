But for all the speed and joy of the fastest set of men on earth, they followed an event that is both much less appreciated in the United States and almost unimaginably grueling. The American Bryan Clay's triumphant moment in the decathlon came after he all but staggered across the finish line at the end of the 1,500 meters. The track announcer greeted him with the news that he was the Olympic champion, to which Clay responded by pitching forward onto the track."
