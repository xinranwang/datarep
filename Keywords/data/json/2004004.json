For several years, a growing number of North Koreans have used China as an escape path. In several incidents, small groups have sought asylum at embassies in Beijing.

One point was understood: as basketball in China undergoes a rapid evolution, each side knows its value to the other. The Chinese officials were in rural Oregon to scout talent for their burgeoning, 14-team professional league, the Chinese Basketball Association. Their first-ever association tryout was to end Wednesday with a three-round draft to fill two slots designated on each team for foreign players."

Many of the projects were commissioned for the 2008 Olympic Games, for which Beijing originally planned to spend a staggering $37 billion -- more than three times what Athens paid -- as it remade the city and its infrastructure. The proposed new venues include a 100,000-seat Olympic stadium by the Swiss architects Herzog & de Meuron wrapped in a ''bird's nest'' of tangled columns, and a swimming center by the Australian firm PTW with a facade of translucent, lightweight panels to be inflated to resemble huge bubbles."

        "lead_paragraph": "BUSINESS TRAVEL RECOVERY -- There will be a steady rebound in business travel throughout the world next year, according to the annual American Express Global Business Travel Forecast, which was released yesterday. ''The business travel industry is certainly in a recovery mode,'' said Matthew Davis, the director of global consulting for American Express. As demand continues to increase, domestic air fares could rise 1 percent to 3 percent, the survey said. Other recent surveys have shown that corporate travel managers are keeping the pressure on domestic prices by continuing to increase their use of cheaper, nonrefundable advance-purchase fares that formerly were categorized as leisure-market fares. International business-class fares, meanwhile, are expected to rise 2 percent to 5 percent, the survey said. In North America, corporate rates for hotels in the mid and upper ranges are expected to rise as much as 3 percent. Business travel grew most sharply on trans-Atlantic and trans-Pacific routes, as well as to South America, said Mr. Davis, who added: ''These trends, we believe, will place upward pressure on prices as demand begins to outpace supply.'' FEDEX EXPANDS IN CHINA -- Underscoring the sharp growth in demand for business travel and cargo services in China, FedEx Express said yesterday that it would add 12 weekly flights to the 11 it currently operates to Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen. FedEx also said it had asked the Transportation Department for authority to add six additional flights to China in 2006 to link Guangzhou to its delivery networks. FedEx has a worldwide fleet of 629 aircraft and delivers more than three million packages daily. MONEY COUNTS -- Affluent travelers are far more likely to keep track of their frequent-flier miles and carefully manage other loyalty-incentive programs, according to a survey by TNS Financial Services. Among travelers with a net worth of more than $250,000 or a household income of more than $100,000, or both, 69 percent use travel-reward programs, compared with 37 percent of nonaffluent travelers, said the survey, which conceded that the rich simply travel more frequently. Nevertheless, affluent travelers are significantly more likely to join airline and hotel loyalty programs and to have credit cards that award points for air travel. Well-heeled travelers have the opportunity and the inclination to ''leverage awards'' in various programs, including free air trips. The survey said that 11 percent of affluent travelers will cash in miles for air travel this year, compared with 2 percent of nonaffluent travelers. PARTY TIME -- Stung by a recent official report that said it spent nearly $500,000 on an awards banquet for employees last November, the Transportation Security Administration is defending the spending. ''Given the hours and productivity of the work force during this critical period, T.S.A. believes the award expenditures were fully justified'' and in compliance with federal policies, the agency said in a statement. In a recent report, the inspector general's office at the Homeland Security Department questioned the spending for the dinner at a luxury Washington hotel, where more than 500 agency employees were cited for exemplary performance. Among the costs were nearly $200,000 for travel and accommodations and $85,000 to hire a professional party planner, according to the internal report; a copy of the report was obtained by The Associated Press.

Through November, visitors can study a disorienting upside-down room, or examine photos of distant nudes on blinding, white ice, or visit a roomful of strange, troubling videos that could fit easily in a Guggenheim anywhere in the world. The exhibit is the 2004 Shanghai Biennale, the fifth offering of adventurous contemporary art reminiscent of the Whitney's biennales in New York City. Perhaps what is most shocking about this outlay of modern creations is how few of the museum's Chinese visitors looked shocked, even at the mock mountain landscape created by a row of naked human bottoms. Only the newcomers to China seem startled, not at the art itself, but at the new and uncharted places today's artists and art galleries in China are managing to explore."
