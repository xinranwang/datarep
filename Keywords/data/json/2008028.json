In the West, at least, many observers see another image: massive air pollution and protesters hounding Olympic torchbearers. Less often seen is the Chinese worker. He or she makes a good deal of what we buy yet remains mysterious. Possibly we think of an exploited sweatshop victim. Possibly, when toy recalls flare across the news cycle, we imagine a threat to our safety. The resulting picture is both dissonant and incomplete -- and the latest chapter in a very old story of West and East. To this centuries-old narrative we can now, somewhat surprisingly, add a specific consumer product: Ospop sneakers. Yes, they're made in China by Chinese workers. But more unusually, and more to the point, they are inspired by Chinese workers. Specifically, Ospop sneakers are based on a design widely worn by such laborers, but with higher-quality materials and structural improvements meant to appeal to a Western audience -- one that is, not incidentally, willing to pay $75 for a pair of sneakers. Since forming last October, Ospop has sold more than 7,500 pairs."
