The route connects an existing line with a new 14-mile extension. City officials say they hope the new line will help alleviate clogged roads. In recent months, Beijing residents have complained that traffic in and around the city has been worse than anytime in years. A recent traffic jam from outside Beijing toward Inner Mongolia lasted for 10 days and drew international attention. Xinhua reported that Beijing has four million cars on the roads, and the city is one of the most congested in the world. Beijing plans to open four other new lines by the end of 2010."

The prize was awarded to a Chinese dissident, Liu Xiaobo, in early October. China is also preventing Mr. Liu's wife, Liu Xia, from leaving the country to collect the prize. On Thursday, Mr. Ai was catching a flight to Seoul, South Korea, and Mr. Mao was going to Singapore. Both were stopped in the Beijing airport and told by the authorities that they could not travel because they might ''endanger state security.'' Mr. Ai said in a Twitter message that he had not intended to go to the Nobel ceremony but that he was instead traveling on a matter related to his art."

But the scale of the original plan has been changed, and alleyways and courtyard homes will no longer be destroyed in the project, the report said. The museum, called the Beijing Time Museum, is being built on a site southeast of the Drum Tower, a 13th-century landmark. The original plan encompassed an area 20 times larger than the current project and ignited criticism from people concerned about the relentless destruction of historic areas in Beijing, China Daily reported. That plan was put on hiatus in September after the wave of criticism and a bureaucratic reshuffling of neighborhood governments."
