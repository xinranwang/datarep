Those usually caught in connection with this China trade are low-level participants, the officials say, making Mr. Chen's recent arrest in Queens a significant step in the struggle to stem the smuggling. But where officials last week described Mr. Chen as a smuggler, able to live as a legal alien in the United States through a marriage of convenience to an American citizen, his lawyer painted a different picture. He said that Mr. Chen was innocent of the smuggling charges and that he had been granted legal-alien status in the United States because of his participation in the pro-democracy demonstrations that Chinese troops crushed in Tiananmen Square in 1989."

The one uncovered today, just nine and a half feet tall, was conceived within weeks of the destruction of the original. But it took almost five years to win the necessary city approvals and to find a permanent home for it on public land, a small park on the edge of this city's Chinatown."
