In the words of a well-known Tibetan religious teacher who died after many years in a Chinese prison, the railway heralds ''a time of emergency and darkness'' for Tibet. This railway across the roof of the world will result in an expanded Chinese military presence in Tibet, accelerate the already devastating exploitation of its natural resources and increase the number of Chinese migrants, marginalizing the Tibetan people still further. In the capital, Lhasa, Tibetans are already a minority."
