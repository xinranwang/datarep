''They haven't told me yet whether we agree or not'' to allow the wreath into the square, the policeman said. He was deferring to higher authorities, presumably jittery because they remembered the last time a senior leader died in 1989 and wreath-laying quickly gave way to demonstrating."

        "lead_paragraph": "The Chrysler Corporation plans to close its Beijing office, saying China's sluggish automobile market offers few opportunities for new projects. The move underscores global companies' disappointment at the slow development of China's auto industry. Production of cars, trucks and buses grew 2.6 percent last year, barely a quarter of the pace for the whole economy. Larry Burger, director of Chrysler projects in China, said the company no longer saw the need for a representative office. Some sales and marketing staff will be moved to a joint-venture plant making Jeeps in Beijing. Chrysler's bid to expand its China presence was foiled two years ago when Beijing picked Daimler-Benz A.G. to build a $1 billion mini-van and engine factory."
