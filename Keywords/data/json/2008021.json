I didn't have a very high expectation for the opening ceremony. For the residents of Beijing, including me, it has been a seven-year journey with everyone fighting very hard to be a good host, building venues, cleaning up the cities. The government has issued a lot of new regulations on regular people, which makes ordinary life a little more inconvenient. For example, the traffic control rules, rising rents because of landlords' desire to make more money after the Olympics, and the close scrutiny of the Chinese by the world media. All of this made me a little sick of the Olympics. It became less a celebration and more of a test of my country and its people."

Then Tian Yuan passed around the stickers -- Chinese flags and red hearts with the yellow Communist star -- and the crowd at the Nashville Bar began to perk up. Ms. Tian, 29, an executive assistant at GlobalLogic, an American software company, said she had overcome her initial lack of interest in the Games and organized a viewing party for 20 friends, human resource executives, marketing managers and public relations strategists."

And if the astonishing opening ceremonies of the 2008 Olympic Games lavished grand tribute on Chinese civilization and sought to stir an ancient nation's pride, there was also a message for an uncertain outside world: Do not worry. We mean no harm. Usually, that message is delivered by the dour-faced leaders of the ruling Communist Party, who dutifully, if sometimes unconvincingly, regurgitate the phrase ''harmonious society'' coined by President Hu Jintao. But in the nimble cinematic hands of Zhang Yimou, the filmmaker who directed the opening ceremonies, the politics of harmony were conveyed in a visual extravaganza."
