And thanks to increased longevity and the one-child policy, it is quickly aging. Demographers estimate that by 2050, more than a quarter of the people in China will be 60 or older. Visitors to the Olympics, however, can be forgiven for thinking that China is a land of unnatural youthfulness where nobody is older than 30. About 100,000 volunteers, wearing blue ''Beijing 2008'' shirts, are working at these Games, staffing the security stations, driving golf carts, answering questions or just standing around and greeting people -- ''communicating smile and building harmony,'' in the words of a Beijing organizing committee news release. Close to 90 percent of them are in their 20s. Older Chinese, and there are plenty in Beijing, are mostly out of sight."
