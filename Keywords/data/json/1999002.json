That is just one of several serious problems facing Mr. Clinton in the aftermath of last week's mistaken bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade. Another is China itself, which showed an ominously volatile side in its response to the accidental attack. In his six years as President, Mr. Clinton has not faced a more difficult set of foreign policy challenges. Only a few days ago, China seemed likely to go along with whatever peace plan Russia and the United States brought to the United Nations Security Council, where Beijing has a veto. Despite accusations of Chinese espionage at American nuclear weapons labs and Chinese efforts to influence the 1996 elections with improper campaign contributions, relations with Beijing seemed stable after last month's visit here by Prime Minister Zhu Rongji."
