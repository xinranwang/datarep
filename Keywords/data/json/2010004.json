Today in Laogucheng, a dingy warren of apartments and shops slated for redevelopment on Beijing's far west side, the fruits of that effort are on vivid display: a powerful developer is racing to demolish the neighborhood before the rules are passed. And about 700 gritty homeowners are adamantly refusing to move until they get the fair deal they hope the rules will provide."

The death toll from the military action against the protesters, which occurred on June 4, 1989, remains in dispute.

The calligraphy was done around 1095 by Huang Tingjian, a leading scholar and poet of the Song dynasty. The auction was held on Thursday by the Poly Group, which has a vast historic art collection and is one of the largest art auction houses in China. The buyer of the artwork remained anonymous. There was no independent confirmation of the record set during the auction. One report said the previous record amount paid at auction for a piece of Chinese art was $34 million, for a Yuan dynasty vase sold in 2005 at an auction in London."

Here's how The Times described the confrontation at the time: ''It all started with a man in a white shirt who walked into the street and raised his right hand no higher than a New Yorker hailing a taxi. ... The man stood only half as tall as the lead tank. But his body language made it clear: He wanted the slow-moving column halted, and halt it did, the huge treads on the lead tank grinding to a stop just a few feet from his face. It was a close call -- the tank came perhaps a second or two of killing him -- and it seemed to encapsulate many of the confrontations in recent days between the citizens and the army: the touch-and-go maneuvering, with soldiers not sure when to press on and when to retreat; the determination of the demonstrators, brave and unyielding in ways that might have been unthinkable a few weeks ago.''"
