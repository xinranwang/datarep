After news media reports on Saturday that the Chinese had taken the architect, Patrick Henri Devillers, 51, into custody, a spokesman for the French Foreign Ministry said that Mr. Devillers was being ''housed'' in ''proper conditions'' and that he was not in prison. ''He is well; he's in great health,'' said the spokesman, Bernard Valero."
