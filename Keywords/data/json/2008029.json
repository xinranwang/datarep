Sales rose 16 percent, to 7.9 billion yuan, from 6.83 billion yuan. Tsingtao, based in the eastern Chinese city of Qingdao, is hoping to use publicity from the sponsorship to increase full-year beer volume growth. Rising costs for electricity and raw materials are making production more expensive at Chinese brewers. Tsingtao Brewery, 27 percent owned by Anheuser-Busch, is aiming for a year-over-year increase in sales volume of 13 percent in 2008, after growing 11 percent in 2007."

They form a seemingly haphazard collection -- some country names are written in English, some in other languages. But they are actually part of a grand design, regulated by a phone-book-sized set of International Olympic Committee rules. Because country names on the front must be written in the Latin alphabet, countries like China compensate by using Chinese characters on the back. Flags and sponsor logos must be in a certain place and a certain size. The colors are regulated."

Three other people, including a New York artist who fashions giant displays with lasers on buildings, were detained for a separate protest. Representatives of the group Students for a Free Tibet, which organized both protests, said they had yet to hear from those who had been detained. ''We're always worried when someone is in Chinese detention,'' said Lhadon Tethong, the executive director of the group."
