One measure to take more than a million cars off the road will be enforced from July 20 to Sept. 20, a period that includes the Olympic and Paralympic Games. The Chinese news media outlined the plan months ago, but the government waited until Friday to announce it. It will restrict owners of private cars to driving on alternate days, depending on whether the last number of their license plate is even or odd, officials said at a news conference. Operating hours for public transportation will be extended during the two-month period, the officials said."

        "lead_paragraph": "NEW ROUND OF FARE INCREASES After Southwest Airlines said late last week that it was raising round-trip fares by up to $20, the network carriers quickly joined in with their own across-the-board fare increases. By the weekend, all six network carriers -- American, United, Delta, US Airways, Continental and Northwest -- had raised round-trip fares by up to $40 on most routes. It was the 14th fare increase this year by the major carriers, according to Rick Seaney of FareCompare.com. AIR TAXI SERVICE Linear Air, which provides air taxi service, is opening a hub at the Westchester County Airport near New York City. Service at the airport, which is in White Plains, starts July 1, using an Eclipse 500 jet. Unlike DayJet, which flies Eclipse 500s with individual seats sold on demand in Florida and adjacent states, Linear sells the entire plane, configured with three seats, on demand. Linear Air, based in Concord, Mass., has a fleet of four Eclipse 500s and five 8-passenger Cessna Grand Caravan turboprops, and offers service between regional airports in the Northeast, mid-Atlantic and eastern Canada."
