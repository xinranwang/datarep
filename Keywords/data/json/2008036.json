The byproduct of automobiles, slash-and-burn agriculture, cooking on dung or wood fires and coal-fired power plants, these plumes rise over southern Africa, the Amazon basin and North America. But they are most pronounced in Asia, where so-called atmospheric brown clouds are dramatically reducing sunlight in many Chinese cities and leading to decreased crop yields in swaths of rural India, say a team of more than a dozen scientists who have been studying the problem since 2002."

Maggies had existed for more than a decade in several locations and was notorious amongst Beijing expatriates for its Mongolian prostitutes who catered exclusively to foreign men, a business decision that kept the cops from the door, at least until the pre-Olympic clean up campaign."

China's leaders are unwisely refusing to seriously pursue a compromise. Tibetans, especially younger Tibetans, are increasingly frustrated. Eight rounds of talks since 2002 between the Dalai Lama's representatives and Chinese officials have yielded no progress. Beijing has invested heavily to improve the quality of life in Tibet. But it continues to restrict Tibetans' rights, while seeking to dilute their power by encouraging Han Chinese to migrate to the region."

        "lead_paragraph": "''A country, a style or an epoch are interesting only for the idea behind them,'' Christian Dior wrote in his 1957 autobiography, ''Christian Dior and I.'' That said, the exacting French couturier might well have approved of ''Christian Dior and Chinese Artists,'' an exhibition that recently opened at the Ullens Center for Contemporary Art in Beijing. In a former factory space in the city's booming 798 arts district, 50 works specially commissioned for the exhibition commingle with the original couture gowns by Dior and John Galliano (creative director since 1997) that inspired them. The slick, fun-house setting was designed by Alexandre de Betak, who has for many years been responsible for the production of Galliano's phantasmagorical runway shows. Highlights include Li Songsong's 10-foot-tall Lady Dior handbag constructed from neon rods; Xu Zhongmin's strobe-lighted mechanical runway; and Zhang Huan's portrait of Dior made from incense ashes collected from thousands of Buddhist temples. A series of curtains strung with mother-of-pearl beads (an idea that goes back to the Tang dynasty) by the formerly exiled artist Huang Rui serve as both a time line, emphasizing quite literally the weight of history, and a gateway to the exhibition. In fashion, Dior casts a very long shadow -- and not just over the doorstep of his own house. John Galliano first visited China in 2002 -- five years after Dior opened its first boutique there -- and returned to Paris to make a wild, chinoiserie couture collection that gave a whole new meaning to the words New Look. Galliano says he found Shanghai ''incredibly modern.'' But he added: ''Driving out to the country, in 20 minutes you have the feeling you have traveled back centuries. That contrast really turned me on.'' At its best, the exhibition sparks a dialogue between East and West, art and commerce, fashion and politics, and between the artists. According to Bérénice Angremy, a curator who consulted on the project in Beijing, some of the artists had not spoken to one another in more than a decade. Here 18 of the 22 artists are gathered with Galliano on opening night for a group photo. ''It all surprised me,'' he says of the work in the show. ''It is always inspiring to see Dior through someone else's eyes.''"
