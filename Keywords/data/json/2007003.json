''I'm touching your head!'' said one, like a mischievous child. ''Who just said that?'' another replied. The disembodied voices floated across the boisterous 90-plus-seat restaurant, but no one could see who was talking, except for the waiters, who were outfitted with military-grade night-vision goggles. In a new twist on conceptual dining, restaurants are turning off the lights to focus attention on the food. The trend seems to have started in Zurich and has since spawned permutations all over the world, with diners donning blindfolds, sitting in unlit rooms and, lately, being served by waiters in night-vision goggles. The idea is that by depriving one sense (sight), other senses are heightened."

In a telephone interview this week, Baron Guy Ullens, who, with his wife, Myriam, perfectly fits that description -- they sold their Turners, the biggest group to come on the market in more than a century, for $21 million this month at Sotheby's -- hastened to add that he was educated mostly in the United States.
