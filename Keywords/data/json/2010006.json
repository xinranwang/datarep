Last month, the Agricultural Bank of China made its stock market debut, bringing in $22 billion for the largest public offering ever. A sister government-run bank, the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, now has the highest stock market value of any bank in the world. But the windfalls have created an unusual problem for China: white-collar unrest. A few days after the Agricultural Bank went public, dozens of former bank employees stealthily gathered outside the headquarters of the country's central bank. There, after distributing small Chinese flags, they quickly pulled on red and blue T-shirts that read, ''Protect the Rights of Downsized Bank Workers.'' By the time they had unfurled their protest banners, the game was over."
