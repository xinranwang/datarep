But as the summer doldrums of August took hold, the mainstream news media actually shifted their focus to the war between Russia and Georgia. About 26 percent of news coverage was devoted to the Russia-Georgia conflict during the week of Aug. 11 to 17, according to the Project for Excellence in Journalism, a research group in Washington that surveys the news media. The war received more coverage than the 2008 campaign and two other big events that week, the Olympics and John Edwards's admission that he had an affair, the report said."
