The Chinese Olympic committee waits for a Swedish coach to transform its cross-country ski team and for speedskaters training in Canada to dominate their events. Outside China, the world waits to see whether the country will become as big a force in the Winter Games as it has become in the Summer Games, where it is not only poised to play host to the next Olympics in 2008, but may also dominate the medal count after spending the past decade building a summer sports machine."

This 90-minute episode, produced by the provocative filmmaker Antony Thomas, argues that although the Tank Man's gesture did not lead to his government's collapse after soldiers fired on peaceful protesters, it inspired reformers everywhere to challenge totalitarian oppressors."

A large dust storm hit the capital, turning skies a murky yellow and coating buildings and streets in fine powder. While dust storms are not unusual in China, particularly in the spring, ''this one was quite a bit more extreme than they've had in recent years,'' said Thomas E. Gill, an associate professor of geology and environmental science at the University of Texas at El Paso who studies dust storms. The storm's intensity may have been due to drought in China's extensive deserts, or to land clearing and other agricultural practices that leave soil exposed."

At one point, 7,000 workers were toiling on the stadium, dispatched in six-month stints from the countryside and organized like an army into squadrons. When I visited at the end of March, their number had diminished to a couple of thousand: the concrete had already been poured for the huge bowl that will seat 91,000 spectators at the 2008 Olympic Games, and the raising and welding of the steel columns and beams -- tasks that require extra training and elbow room -- were well under way. Cranes more than 300 feet tall hovered above, hoisting metal pieces as heavy as 350 tons to form a lattice of interwoven steel. Knowing that the nickname ''bird's nest'' has clicked with the Chinese public, I could imagine the enormous cranes as Godzilla-fied birds and the dangling curves of steel as worms being lowered for the chicks. The 24 main columns are gargantuan -- 1,000 tons each, far more than the weight of those in a conventional stadium and spaced in what appears to be a random pattern. ''Everyone thinks this is the most remarkable piece of architecture we have ever designed,'' the architect Jacques Herzog told me months before in Switzerland, where he lives. ''To realize that project there is amazing.'' It defies expectations to see this avant-garde building rising in China, and yet, Herzog had remarked, ''such a structure you couldn't do anywhere else.''"

During the Cultural Revolution, when Mao was raised to cult status, it seemed as if the entire nation had set about drawing a Mao portrait, or at least honoring one. If Mao's Little Red Book was the national bible, Mao's official portrait was the national stamp."
