I couldn't even remember what it felt like to be lost. But it all came rushing back to me when I got off a rattletrap airport bus on Jianguomennei Avenue in central Beijing one morning in early October. The 22-hour flight from New York (on Air China for $1,000 round trip) had left me groggy, of course, and the smog was unusually thick, even for Beijing, where many residents cook and heat with coal. Still, I felt sure that if I just walked a few blocks northwest I'd end up on Wangfujing Street, Beijing's main shopping artery, which would eventually lead me to the little Lu Song Yuan Hotel, where I'd booked a room by fax for 298 yuan, about $36, a night (calculating the yuan at 8.3 to the dollar)."
