In 2001, were I on the Olympic Committee, I would have voted to award the Olympics to Beijing as the committee did yesterday, though with serious reservations. In 1980 we were very conscious of several critical considerations. The Soviet Union had just engaged in a direct military aggression against a weaker neighbor: Soviet tanks and paratroopers had invaded Afghanistan in December 1979, and the Soviet military was engaged in bloody massacres of the Afghans on a scale even larger than currently in Chechnya. In these circumstances we had to react in some fashion short of war. We decided on sanctions, and we felt that it would be unfair to our farmers and our industrial workers if our athletes were to act as if nothing atrocious had happened."
