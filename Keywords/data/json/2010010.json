When it had its premiere in April, the opera was hailed by some here as evidence of China becoming a great cultural power."

The merging and sparring of 15th-century trombone and violin with the ancient stringed zheng and piped sheng, heard most powerfully in the finale by the New York-based composer Huang Ruo, seemed to mirror the turmoil within the Catholic Church this Christmas."
