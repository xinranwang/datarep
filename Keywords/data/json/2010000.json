The Obama administration came in with a deeply held philosophical view about making the Chinese stakeholders, and partners, in an interconnected world. Human rights complaints were muted, the Dalai Lama put on hold, and President Obama swung into town in November with arms outstretched to the rising behemoth."

He doesn't know the names of any American baseball teams, and his parents are confused when they watch him play."

So at seemingly ruinous cost, he razes the cornfield and builds a ball field, and is rewarded with an endless stream of ticket buyers stretching to the rural Iowa horizon. In 2008, the Chinese built a ball field -- boy, what a ball field -- known worldwide for its lattice-like architecture as the Bird's Nest. Alas, after the 2008 Olympics, the ticket buyers haven't come. Right now, the Bird's Nest serves as a winter amusement park known as the Happy Ice and Snow Season. In April, a promoter may stage a celebrity rock concert to ''establish China as a world leader for global peace and a healthier planet.'' Or not."
