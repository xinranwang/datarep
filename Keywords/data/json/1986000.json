The Chinese have customarily been been reluctant to allow foreigners to occupy local housing (except in emergencies or by special permit), since it is in desperately short supply. In addition, it is usually deficient by Western standards. Until now, foreigners generally have either lived in hotel rooms that they used as offices or rented hotel-service apartments or suites attached to hotels on a short-term basis. Lately, a severe shortage of available space and an increasing demand by foreign businesses has driven rents up - a suite at one of the better Western-style hotels costs as much as $9,000 a month - and increased the pressure for alternatives. There are no controls on the prices foreigners can be charged for housing."

        "lead_paragraph": "Two days after thousands of university students demonstrated on the streets of Beijing, the city issued rules today that make any further public protest virtually illegal. Even as Beijing was joining other cities in clamping down on student protesters, 10,000 students in Nanjing, the industrialized capital of Jiangsu Province, were reported to have marched through the city calling for greater democracy, part of a continuing student campaign that is sweeping China. The action by the Beijing city government follows a similar action on Monday by the Shanghai authorities, who in effect banned demonstrations. In five days of protests in Shanghai that were brought to a halt earlier this week, more than 50,000 students marched through the streets with banners calling for democracy and freedom."

Some Confucian scholars used to argue that Western scientific knowledge was only a tool that could in the end be used to strengthen traditional values. But others insisted that opening the doors would inexorably erode and destroy the Confucian ethos. Last week, as tens of thousands of students marched through Shanghai's narrow streets shouting slogans for democracy and freedom, the dilemma facing China's leaders was much like the one that had troubled Confucian traditionalists. For as China methodically opens itself, creating an economic landscape akin to the West's, intellectuals are asking: Can the political principles that nourish Western economies be far behind? And if so, what does that entail for the Communist Government and its political values?"

''In order to promote democracy and in order to give the people the opportunity to select the candidates that they will be satisfied with, this time the election will have more candidates than slots available,'' She Diqing, a deputy chairman of the standing committee of the Municipal People's Congress, said in a speech to the committee. Student Protests Banned The announcement, which appeared in Beijing Daily, follows an official crackdown on the wave of student demonstrations that have swept across China demanding wider democracy. On Friday, the standing committee issued a set of rules that in effect banned any public protest by students in the capital."

Meanwhile, in the bitter predawn cold this morning, university students in Beijing, after six days of quiet, and despite a ban on public demonstrations without a police permit, marched on snow-covered streets with calls for greater democracy. [ United Press International reported that some of the students marched with torches - brooms dipped in some sort of flammable liquid - and drums. ] Everywhere in the university district, which is in the northwest corner of the city, policemen roamed the streets in cars and vans."
