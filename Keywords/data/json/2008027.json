Phelps is a self-described klutz, a real fish out of water on land, and he has a surgical scar on his right wrist to prove it. In October he took a nasty stumble that imperiled his pursuit of Mark Spitz's single Games record of seven gold medals. Phelps, 23, slipped on a patch of ice and fell while climbing into a friend's car in Michigan and broke his right wrist."
