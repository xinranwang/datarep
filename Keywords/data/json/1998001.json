Mr. Reagan used that trip to meet with prominent dissidents and speak directly to Soviet audiences about fundamental freedoms and the advantages of democracy, and there was little that his host, Mikhail Gorbachev, could do about it but grumble. Mr. Reagan knew that one of the important powers of a traveling President is the right to speak plainly in lands unaccustomed to open debate. Bill Clinton has the same luxury. The cause of human rights will be poorer if he squanders it. Mr. Clinton's aides have said he will address the issue in some way, and there is no shortage of promising venues. His itinerary includes a small village that has just conducted its first open election, an ecumenical church and a classroom at Beijing University. But there is one obvious setting in which Mr. Clinton can seize the moment, politely but firmly, to assert American values. That is Tiananmen Square, which he will visit on Saturday, and where hundreds of peaceful pro-democracy demonstrators were slaughtered on June 4, 1989."
