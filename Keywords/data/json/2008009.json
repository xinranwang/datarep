There is also a spa. Nightly rates start at about 2,010 yuan, or $289 at 7 yuan to the dollar, through the end of the month, after which the rates will increase to about 2,369 yuan, or $334 at the same exchange rate.

There will be 237 rooms on floors 37 to 49 in the Park Tower (part of the Beijing Yintai Center). Rates are expected to start at 3,500 yuan."
