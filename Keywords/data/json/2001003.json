The program, an homage to the humble cabdriver, has been a fixture of Beijing radio since 1993, occupying a prime morning hour on the main music station. In the city's ever more grasping atmosphere, the show and its main audience seem out of time. But the show remains popular with drivers of cabs, as well as owners of the swelling fleet of private cars, and advertisers seem to have noticed that when cabdrivers tune in, their passengers are most likely to listen, too."

But turning a blind eye to the egregious human rights violations taking place every day in China does not remove politics from the Olympics -- it permits an authoritarian regime to exploit the Games to prop up its faltering legitimacy by gaining an important symbol of acceptance from the international community. The I.O.C. should reject China's bid and protect the Olympic ideal."
