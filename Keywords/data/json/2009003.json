        "lead_paragraph": "For Western pop acts booked in China, it's never certain whether the gig will actually take place. Billboard reported that Beyoncé, below, and Skid Row had been confirmed for performances in Beijing this month but that 14 Western rock bands scheduled for a festival next week weren't so lucky. The bands, which include the Buzzcocks, British Sea Power, Shonen Knife and the (International) Noise Conspiracy, were been booked for the Modern Sky Festival, where the Yeah Yeah Yeahs played two years ago. But on Thursday Modern Sky, the record label and media company behind the festival, said none of the bands would appear. ''The 14 overseas acts previously announced for the 2009 festival are unable to participate due to unforeseen circumstances,'' the company said in a statement. Modern Sky said that the Chinese acts at the festival, scheduled for Sunday to Wednesday, would go on as planned."
