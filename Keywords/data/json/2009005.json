The Commune by the Great Wall, about an hour and a half by car from central Beijing, qualifies in both regards. The project was the brainchild of Zhang Xin, a prominent Chinese real estate developer, who gathered 12 architects from across Asia and asked them to design homes that would serve as lodging for people seeking a retreat from the urban sprawl of Beijing. Ms. Zhang was awarded a special prize at the 2002 Venice Biennale. Guests can stay in one of the original homes, which are costly, or in one of the many copies that were built after Kempinski took over management in 2005."

And when it comes to dealing with China, as American businesses know, confidence in commitment to legal obligations is critical in giving assurances that business can be carried out effectively. For the United States, it provides a bilateral and multilateral negotiation framework."
