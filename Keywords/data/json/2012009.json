Above were the well-preserved beams of the entrance to this 600-year-old temple, but all around us were sleek, minimalist furnishings and a backlit bar."

Like the memory of the revolution itself, the memorial, which opened in 2005, exists in a gray area. The local media rarely write about it. Few who live in Shantou know it is there."

The answer, it seems, could be through private galleries and museums. While China's economic rise is helping to finance a museum-building boom across the country and the government is focusing on strengthening state-run citadels of culture, an increasing number of wealthy philanthropists and patrons of experimental art are constructing new showcases for works by emerging Chinese artists."
