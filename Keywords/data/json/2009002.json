Six-lane ring highways cut through old neighborhoods, making places that are rather close as the crow flies very far apart if you walk, since you've often got to navigate long cloverleaf intersections and widely spaced overpasses simply to cross the street. And that's one of the things, in a city far more oriented toward the car than shoe leather, that makes the recent opening of a big pedestrian-only network of streets in the historic heart of Beijing so noteworthy. It's in the area called Dashalar, which, during the Manchu-ruled Qing Dynasty, was the ethnic Chinese part of this city, the warren of streets and avenues that lay just outside the imposing city wall."
