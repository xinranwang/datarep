No horses were injured because the supervisor at the Happy Valley Racecourse, where horses have been racing since 1846, noticed something on the turf before racing started Wednesday. He discovered the mechanism concealed by grass-colored tape and called in a police bomb squad to remove it."

But in the past week, strange things have happened. A senior Chinese official, Zhai Jun, traveled to Sudan to push the Sudanese government to accept a United Nations peacekeeping force. Mr. Zhai even went all the way to Darfur and toured three refugee camps, a rare event for a high-ranking official from China, which has extensive business and oil ties to Sudan and generally avoids telling other countries how to conduct their internal affairs."

I hadn't been back in 10 years, so this trip was just to see the city again. It's pretty common that these homes are going down to make way for new stuff. We met a family that was still living in that neighborhood, and they invited us into their house to have lunch. I can't imagine that they were thrilled about the demolition, but we didn't have any conversations about it. Everything just changes so fast there. I brought a friend of mine from New York who had never been, and she and I were in the same boat. Going back after 10 years was really like going to the city for the first time.''
