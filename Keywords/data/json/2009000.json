A compulsive poet who oversaw the unprecedented expansion of China's borders, Qianlong began creating a refuge in 1771, at 61, for his golden years.

A spokesman for the Palace Museum in Beijing said that no agreement had been reached on how many would travel. The Taiwan museum plans to borrow the works, mainly paintings, for a three-month exhibition starting in October of art from the reign of Emperor Yongzheng, who ruled from 1723 to 1735. In meetings over the weekend in Beijing the directors of the museums agreed to coordinate their catalogs and Web sites, according to the Taiwan museum, but the two sides did not address mainland China's legal claim to full ownership of the entire imperial collection, which has long been divided by strife. The Nationalists took nearly a quarter of it when they lost China's civil war to the Communists in 1949 and retreated to Taiwan. The Taipei museum refuses to lend any works to the mainland for fear that they will not be returned and has only rarely lent works from the imperial collection to other countries for fear of legal action."
