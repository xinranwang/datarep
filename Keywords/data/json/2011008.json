An outspoken critic of the Chinese government, Mr. Ai was detained without charge earlier this year for nearly three months. After he was released, the authorities said his company Fake Culture Ltd. -- which is registered in the name of his wife, Lu Qing -- owed $2.4 million in back taxes and fines and gave him until Wednesday to pay. By putting up roughly half now as a guarantee, Mr. Ai can request an administrative review of the accusations. If he loses, he would have to pay the balance or could sue the tax offices."
