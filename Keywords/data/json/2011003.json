The missing items date to the early 20th century and include jewelry boxes. They belong to Feng Yaohui, a Hong Kong collector, and were part of the Liangyicang private museum. The last attempted burglary at the Forbidden City took place in 1987, Global Times reported, citing a Web site administered by the Ministry of Public Security. At least 1,600 antitheft alarms, 3,700 smoke detectors and 3,700 cameras monitor the Forbidden City after it closes to the public at 5 p.m., Global Times reported, citing an article in Legal Mirror on May 1. The exhibition was scheduled to run from April 29 to June 27."

Rumors about the club surfaced last week, when Rui Chenggang, an anchor for China Central Television, said on his microblog that the entry fee was one million renminbi, or about $154,000. Officials sent a statement to Global Times saying there were no plans to open any club."

The agency, the Beijing Administration of Industry and Commerce, is looking into wrongdoing by the Forbidden City Cultural Development Company, which had been charged by the palace's management office with organizing salons and lectures. Instead, the company began handing out ''membership sign-up forms'' without telling the managers, a palace spokesman said. The company reportedly wanted to sign up 500 members at a charge of one million renminbi each, or about $154,000."
