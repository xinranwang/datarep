Vendors screamed out prices for water and postcards, and pedestrians hacked into handkerchiefs and covered their faces with masks. Construction workers in torn, dirty jeans bored a hole into the sidewalk, geysering dirt everywhere. But inside Three on the Bund, overlooking this chaos from a restored 1916 structure that once housed the Mercantile Bank of India, China's urgency and insanity seemed far away. In the cavernous front room of the Evian Spa by Three, which rises several stories and lets in beams of light from its portholelike windows, the only noise was the tinkling of soft music. Spa attendants led guests past polished wood Chinese sculptures and into private rooms, where they could wallow in giant bathtubs and choose from an exhaustive menu of rubs and facials."

Although President Bush has decided to attend the Games and give them his imprimatur, activists have scored a notable success. Mia Farrow managed to embarrass the Chinese government, as well as Steven Spielberg, a consultant for the opening ceremony, by suggesting that Chinese subsidies to the Sudanese government are contributing to the mass killings in Darfur. The phrase ''Genocide Olympics,'' used by Farrow in The Wall Street Journal, was particularly upsetting to the Chinese. Spielberg quickly told them that genocide was bad. And just as swiftly the Chinese government endorsed a United Nations decision to send peacekeepers to Darfur."

The store, Sugar Jar, is barely big enough to accommodate a half-dozen customers, and one wall displays all the essentials of the genre, from discs of abstract electronica and brutal noise-rock to anthologies with bold titles like ''China: The Sonic Avant-Garde.'' Playing samples from his stock, the proprietor, a lanky, soft-spoken man named Lao Yang, noted proudly that his store is one of the only spots in all of Beijing to buy much of this music."
