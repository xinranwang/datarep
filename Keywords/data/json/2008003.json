Even when handed that undeserved dispensation, the Beijing government cannot control its authoritarian nature. A week of protests in Tibet turned violent last Friday as Chinese security forces clashed with hundreds of Buddhist monks and other ethnic Tibetans. Information was hard to verify -- nearly all foreigners are barred from entering and Tibetans have no freedom -- but news reports said a market in the capital was burned; at least 16, and perhaps many more, people were killed; and paramilitary police and troops were deployed. Over the weekend, rioting spread to neighboring provinces, and demonstrations even reached Beijing."

It acknowledged firing on demonstrators in Sichuan. Yet, the response of the international community -- and of the International Olympic Committee -- has been tepid. Beijing must be called to account, especially since it will host the 2008 Games. We are just learning details of what happened. China has blocked most news coverage despite a pledge to give freer access to journalists in the run-up to the Olympics. Tibetan exile groups say about 100 people died in violence that followed a week of peaceful protests. Beijing puts the toll at about 20. In any case, the violence is neither acceptable nor particularly surprising."
