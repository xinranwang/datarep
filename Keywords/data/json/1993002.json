Sydney, Australia, is running second, and Manchester, England, is a possible surprise choice, while Berlin and Istanbul are rank outsiders."

Equally important, the International Olympic Committee avoided a bad choice -- Beijing -- that would have mired the Games in years of controversy. Australia was host to the 1956 Olympics in Melbourne, before the ascendancy of professional athletes, commercial sponsorship and global politics that now color the Games. At the Sydney Games in the year 2000, thousands of paid and subsidized athletes will compete along with the world's best amateurs, and the Games themselves will be backed by the best sponsorship money can buy. But politics will probably be subdued, which would not be the case if Beijing had been chosen."

Will teen-agers from Yonkers on church-sponsored trips have to run through the streets because the outfield is closed? Will I have to give up sarcasm?"

Last week, Sydney narrowly beat Beijing in a five-city race to host the 2000 Summer Olympics. But it was far from clear why the International Olympic Committee voted as it did. Until the last moment, Beijing was expected to win. The United States Congress had opposed, on human rights grounds, China's full-court press to promote itself. But such objections prompted some committee members to counter that the Olympics would open up China politically. Further, some Olympic sponsors like Coca-Cola saw the games as a chance to tap China's consumer market."
