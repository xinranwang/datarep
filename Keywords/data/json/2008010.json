Sports fans attending the 2008 Olympics in Beijing will have a long list of rules to carry in their pockets along with their tickets. On its Web site last week, the Chinese Olympic organizing committee listed a set of restrictions for the 500,000 overseas visitors expected in August. Olympic spectators are being told not to bring in ''anything detrimental'' to China, including printed materials, photos, records or movies. Religious or political banners or slogans are banned. So are rallies, demonstrations and marches -- unless approved by authorities in advance. It also says that visitors with mental illnesses and sexually transmitted diseases will be barred from the country."

The parents of the diver, Hu Jia, had surrendered him to trainers from the Chinese sports establishment at the age of 10, and had seen little of him since then. In an interview with a Chinese newspaper after the diver's injury, his father suggested that this was sacrifice enough. Had he known his son risked blindness, the father said, ''I would never have sent him off to dive.''"
