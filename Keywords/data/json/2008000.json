Mr. Zhang, with four friends, was taking a variety of drugs when the police burst into his apartment, the Xinhua news agency reported, crediting a Beijing television account. A urine sample tested positive for ketamine and crystal meth, the report said. Mr. Zhang, named by Time magazine in 1994 as one of 100 young world leaders for the 21st century, is one of China's Sixth Generation filmmakers, whose works have addressed alienation, nihilism and homosexuality. Although he has won acclaim and awards, some of his films have been banned in China."

Either that or Mr. Jia has an uncanny gift for the metaphorically charged location. His films have taken place within the plastic confines of an Epcot-like Beijing theme park (''The World''), amid the forlorn public spaces of a declining post-industrial city (''Unknown Pleasures'') and in an ancient riverside town that is about to disappear underwater (''Still Life,'' which won the top prize at the 2006 Venice International Film Festival and which opened in New York on Friday). The story of a man and a woman on parallel quests to find their long-lost spouses, ''Still Life'' is set in Fengjie, 150 miles upstream from the Three Gorges Dam, the hydroelectric project on the Yangtze River that submerged thousands of towns and villages and displaced more than a million people. Shot while Fengjie was being demolished and prepared for its eventual flooding, the film has a powerful documentary flavor, but it also borders on the surreal. The protagonists wander through rubble-strewn wastelands. Entire buildings crumble on camera. The epic scale of the devastation matches, even as it violates, the region's majestic natural beauty."

The announcement, the first official confirmation of deaths at the city's Olympic construction sites, was intended to refute a recent account in the British press, which reported that at least 10 workers had died while working at the National Stadium."

        "lead_paragraph": "When state security agents burst into his apartment last month, Hu Jia was chatting on Skype, the Internet-based telephone system. Mr. Hu's computer was his most potent tool. He disseminated information about human rights cases, peasant protests and other politically touchy topics even though he often lived under de facto house arrest. Mr. Hu, 34, and his wife, Zeng Jinyan, are human rights advocates who spent much of 2006 restricted to their apartment in a complex with the unlikely name of Bo Bo Freedom City. She blogged about life under detention, while he videotaped a documentary titled ''Prisoner in Freedom City.'' Their surreal existence seemed to reflect an official uncertainty about how, and whether, to shut them up."
