        "lead_paragraph": "IT is still possible, just barely, to get a glimpse of what daily life for Beijingers was like at the last turn of the century. You can't do it by touring the Forbidden City or by competing for dubious antiques in the ersatz Qing dynasty market of Liulichang. But you can by taking a relaxed stroll through one of the city's oldest residential quarters, near the string of willow-lined lakes to the northwest of the Forbidden City above Beihai Park. In my first week in Beijing, I was introduced to a particular walk that transformed my impression of what is generally a frenzied, frazzling city, stripped of its history. I have retraced the same path several times since, always finding something different and always feeling rejuvenated by the slowed pace, the human scale and just enough remnants of the old days to fire the imagination."
