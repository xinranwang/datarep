Look to the opening of Leni Riefenstahl's 1938 film, ''Olympia.'' In that homage to Berlin's 1936 Olympic Games the origins of this ritual are revealed. Never before had a lighted torch been relayed from a Greek temple in Olympia to an athletic competition, let alone by thousands of runners trying to keep it from being extinguished."

Even spray-painting outdoors will be banned during the weeks before and after sporting events, which begin here on Aug. 8. Although officials initially suggested that the city's wholesale transformation would be complete long before the opening ceremonies, the announcement nonetheless represents the most detailed plan yet for how Beijing might reach its longstanding pledge to stage ''green Games'' in one of the world's most polluted cities. In the past, officials had suggested that the city's makeover would be completed well before the Games, possibly by the end of 2007."

We never learned who he was or what really happened because of the amazing reaction of the authorities, which was caught on film by a tourist. The first frame shows a tall flame and shocked tourists. In the next, a Volga sedan wheels into the square, then a middle-aged man is stuffed into the trunk. But in this and subsequent frames, the attention of the crowd is elsewhere -- every fourth man in the area is grabbing a camera, opening it and exposing the film. The tourist whose film I saw had been behind a tree away from the action. I suspect his was the only record of what happened. Most witnesses recalled only the fire and the goons grabbing their cameras."
