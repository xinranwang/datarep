While Administration officials continue to yearn for a ''strategic partnership'' with Beijing, China's leaders make no effort to conceal the fact they consider the United States an enemy -- or, more precisely, the enemy. How else can one interpret the Chinese Government's response to the bombing? Instead of trying to contain the damage to diplomatic relations, as any friendly nation would have after such an obvious if tragic mistake, the Chinese Government used its vast propaganda machine to whip up anti-American hysteria."

        "lead_paragraph": "Russia's special envoy on the Kosovo crisis, Viktor S. Chernomyrdin, met on Tuesday with China's top leaders to discuss the issue, as rage continued to boil here in response to the NATO bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade. But early today, with demonstrations halted at least temporarily, the American Ambassador, James Sasser, walked out a back door to leave the embassy for the first time since Saturday, when angry demonstrations began. He planned to greet American families in nearby diplomatic residential compounds and then return to the embassy, where officials were hoping they could resume their work."
