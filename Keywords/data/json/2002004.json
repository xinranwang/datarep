We put our bags on the overhead shelf of our sleeper compartment and settled in for the 20-hour ride to Huang Shan, a city in the lush and mountainous Anhui Province of China. As the train hissed out and rumbled through a countryside filled with farmland and idle industrial parks, we looked out the window and wondered whether anyone would be joining us in our four-passenger compartment. After a lunch of bamboo and bony pork in the crowded meal car, it became common knowledge that there were two foreigners in the sleeper section. Passengers began casually strolling by, looking into our open-doored compartment in curiosity."
